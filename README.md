# Focus-Keeper
Focus Keeper is a desktop app that blocks user-inputted websites from being accessed. This is meant to help users stay focused when working on their computer.  

Focus Keeper is written in Python and uses the Tkinter library for its user interface. It also uses Firebase to store user information and blocked websites between sessions.
